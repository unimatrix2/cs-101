# CS-101

This is a public repository that documents my journey through the basics of computer science. It contains notes, lessons, and small projects that I've created to exercise my learning.

## Structure
Except for the `projects` directory, all of them belong to [LogSeq](https://logseq.com), a markdown, graph based text editor that I use to take notes and write a journal.

The `projects` folder contains small projects that I've created to exercise my learning. Most of them consist of CLI tools that take some input and return some output.

## Contributing

If you find any errors or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I'm always looking for ways to improve my understanding of computer science, and I welcome any feedback or contributions.
